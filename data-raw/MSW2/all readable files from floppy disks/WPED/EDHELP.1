User-Defined Help Screens

     You can use Editor to create your own help screens.  The screen
     should be no longer than 24 lines.  Save the screen using the filename
     EDHELP.?, where ? is a letter from A through Z or a number from 0 through
     9.  For example: EDHELP.A, EDHELP.2.

     To display a user-defined help screen, press Help (F3), then select
     User-Defined Help Screens select (u) to enter the user defined 
     help mode and display this screen (EDHELP.1). 
     Then, type the letter or number you used as the EDHELP file extension. 
     For example, type a to display EDHELP.A, or type 2 to display EDHELP.2.

     Pressing a key that does not match an EDHELP file extension takes you out
     of the user help mode.  If the key accesses a regular Help screen, that
     screen is displayed.  Otherwise, you are returned to the main Help screen.
     You can return to the user help mode at any time by typing u.

     Note:   You can edit or replace the EDHELP.1 file (this screen).
             The new EDHELP.1 screen will be displayed when you type
             u from the main Help screen.
