N in Ruler line forces reformatting off, including F7 manual reformat key.
A in Ruler line forces automatic reformatting on.

Centering and Flush Right
Shf F8 centers and Ctl F8 sets flush right a line or marked block of text
to current Ruler spacing. For proportional fonts, use C or F in Ruler line
instead of Shf F8 and Ctl F8.

Controlling Reformatting
To keep a paragraph from joining with the next one, end it with an Alt K,
Keep Paragraph font character. To also justify the last line of a paragraph
(normally not justified) end it with an Alt J, Justify font character.
A #J or #K line in the print control file makes Alt J and Alt K printer
fonts, instead of end paragraph fonts.

To protect a section of text from reformatting place a .- Dot line at the
start of the section and a .+ Dot line at the end.

Use automatic numbering for footnotes, lines, and outlines. You enter a
Numbering Sequence that is translated into a sequential series of numbers
when you repage. See REPAGING. See HEADERS/FOOTERS for page numbering.

First create a unique numbering sequence. Each sequence element contains:
1. An Alt N font character ()
2. A number or letter
3. A symbol (anything but a digit or letter, including a space)

When you Repage, the numbers or letters become sequential.
The symbol, which indicates the sequence, remains the same.


Example
( is the Alt N font character)
 1. Cats
 3. Dogs
 2. Mice

After repage:
 1. Cats
 2. Dogs
 3. Mice


Multiple Levels. Create multiple sequences for outlines or section numbering.
  before an entry uses the number or letter shown as the series start.
 before an entry re-uses the last value.

Example:
 7. Chapter 1  (two sequences, ending with dot and a space)
    A. Cats    (another sequence using capital letters ends with a dot)
 8. Chapter 3
    A. Dogs
    C. Mice

When repaged is:
 1. Chapter 1
    A. Cats
 2. Chapter 2
    A. Dogs
    B. Mice

Footnote Numbering
Use Alt N to number footnote entries. Start each entry with Alt N and the
number or letter and symbol for the series. Repage, and the numbers update to
the current order of the footnotes in the document. In this example, the actual
footnote number ends with "." and the footnote reference with "]":

This is the reference [9] to cats.
.DB
 9. This is footnote text about cats.
.DQ

Here are some DOS COMMANDS you may find useful. PC-Write has keystrokes for
most of these file operations. "A>" is the DOS prompt. See FILE MANAGEMENT.

COPY
A>COPY fromfile tofile
  copies "fromfile" to "tofile"

DEL
A>DEL filename
  deletes the file "filename"

DIR
A>DIR B:
  lists files in drive B

FORMAT
A>FORMAT B:
  formats diskette in drive B

RENAME
A>RENAME oldname newname
  renames "oldname" to "newname"

SORT
A>SORT < infilename > outfilename
  sorts lines in "infilename" and puts them in "outfilename"

TYPE
A>TYPE filename
  displays contents of "filename"

File Names
DOS file names are 1 to 8 characters, plus an extension of 0 to 3 letters.
The format is: filename.ext

You can use the letters A-Z (upper and lower case are the same), numbers 0-9,
and the symbols   $ & # @ ! % ( ) { } - _ ~   in a filename.

The filename can be preceded by a drive specification, and/or a pathname,
for example:   C:\PCW\filename.ext

Think of the drive and path as part of the full filename. When no drive and/or
path is specified DOS assumes the currently logged drive and subdirectory.

L Left Margin:

Normal - A normal paragraph is any line followed by lines that start at the
current left margin setting. Wordwrap moves the cursor to L.

   Not a Paragraph - This looks like a paragraph, but is not. The second line
   starts a new paragraph, because it does not start at the L margin.

Example:
L---P---T1----+-T-2---T---3--T-+----R
    The P margin (not a left margin)
sets the first line of a paragraph.
It can be left or right of the left
margin for all paragraph styles. The
P is optional. You can space or tab
to the first line indent. The Enter
key goes to the P margin.

K Left Margin

Keep - Forces all text to the K left margin.
To indent or hang indent the first line, use a P margin.

Example:
K---+---T1----+-T-2---T---3--T-+-R
   When reformatted, these
     lines will all
  line up with the K in the Ruler.

I Left Margin

For normal indented paragraphs with different left margins, such as quotes,
use the I Ruler letter. Wordwrap goes to the indent of the line above.

Example:
I---+---T1----+-T-2---T---3--T-+-R
Enter takes the cursor to the I.

&&&&"Following lines will wrap
    at the indent above. "
    (& is a space you typed.)

Hanging Indent - Several methods:

1. Shf Enter: use to align new lines under the indent of the line above.
   Good for lists. For example:

L---+---T1---+-T-2---T---3--T-+-R
Here's a list: <Enter>
&&&1. Cats are cranky. <Shf Enter>
   2. Cats drag in mice. <Shf Enter>
   3. (& is a space you type)

2. P margin outdent: If many sections are to use exactly the same hanging
   outdent, a Ruler with a  P to the left of L is useful. For example:

P---+---L1----+-T-2---T---3--T-+-R
Press enter and cursor goes to P,
        while wrapping will be to
        the L margin.

3. H left margin: For a quick hanging indent, or indenting to more than one
   left margin use the H Ruler letter. Wordwrap goes to the indent of the
   line above. For example:

H---+---T1----+-T-2---T---3--T-+-R
Enter takes the cursor to the H.
&&&&&Wrap below this line uses the
     indent of the line above.
     (& is a space you typed)

4. Tag text - E and G left margins

Use Ruler left margins E ("Even") and G ("Glue") for paragraphs that have
"tag text" like a number, bullet, or name, hanging on the left. The E margin
aligns the left edge of tags while the G aligns right edges of tags. Examples:

P---+---E1----+-T-2---T---3--T-+-R
Sam:    "Look at our names!"
Sally:  "Yes, they are flush left."

P---+G--T1----+-T-2---T---3--T-+-J
  9. This   text   is    justified.
 10. The numbers print flush right.

Shorthand mode lets you type an abbreviation for a word and have it replaced by
the full word, using a list you supply.

To Create a Shorthand File
1. Edit or create a file named WORDS.SHO.

2. Enter one line per abbreviation and replacement, using the format:
   abbreviation:replacement

3. Create the file in alphabetical order, or use the DOS SORT command
   after the file is created by issuing the following DOS commands:
   COPY  WORDS.SHO  WORDS.TMP
   SORT <WORDS.TMP >WORDS.SHO
   DEL   WORDS.TMP

To Turn on Shorthand Mode
1. Press Alt F2, then F5.

2. Press F9 for Shorthand mode.

3. Enter name of shorthand file, if not WORDS.SHO.

To perform box operations on text:
1. Place the cursor at any corner of the box.
2. Press Ctl F7 (or Shf Ctl F6) to start Boxing mode.
3. To mark the box, move the cursor to diagonal opposite corner.
4. Some box operations first freeze the box size, creating BOXED mode.

Notes:
* Pressing Ctl F7 to mark a box forces Hide mode.
  You can go to Show mode with Alt Space, but Hide mode works better.
* Box moves and copies overwrite existing text or spaces.
  If you're about to overwrite text, you get a warning.
  If you're moving or copying, first clear the target area.
* Column Boxing mode pushes text down instead of overwriting. (See COLUMNS.)

Operations you can do in Boxing Mode:

Press                To Do

Ctl F7               Move the cursor to the upper left corner
Ctl F5               Mark the entire file as a vertical slice
F3, move cursor, F3  Set BOXED mode, Copy box
F6, move cursor, F6  Set BOXED mode, Move box
F4                   Delete box
Ctl F6               Copy a box to another file
Shf Ctl F6           Append box to the Hold Area
Ctl F4               Undelete a just-deleted box
Shf Ctl End          Move to upper left of moved or deleted box
Ctl F3               Insert a file as a box
Shf Ins or Shf Del   Slide box text right or left
Alt F10 then F9      Repeat replace within box
Alt F6 then F5       Delete font characters within box
Alt F6 then F6       Insert font characters around box
Ctl F9 then F2       Frame box, double line
Ctl F9 then F3       Frame box, single line
Ctl F9 then F4       Unframe box (frame with blanks)

If you have a Marked or Boxed area and you use an operation that applies
to the whole file, not just the marked or boxed part, you get a warning.

For your printer to work correctly you must do the following.
Double check these if you are having printer trouble, and see PROBLEM SOLVING.

1. Note printer brand, model, and mode.
Check printer and printer manual.
Compare dip switch settings with manual to determine the mode.
Mode often governs character set and/or type styles available.
When making changes, write down settings as they were when you started.

2. Run the Printer Picker.
This creates a print control file for your printer, PR.DEF by default.
It runs when you install PC-Write with WORKDISK.
It can be run alone to change printers or modes. 
With the PC-Write Utility Diskette in drive A:> type:

   A> MENUPRT d:\subdir\filename  <Enter>

Use MENULAZ in place of MENUPRT for laser printers. Make choices as prompted.
"d:\subdir\" is the drive and subdirectory where the working copy of PC-Write
is located. If you have only one printer, use PR.DEF as the "filename".
If you have more than one printer connected to your computer, run the Printer
Picker once for each printer, giving a unique filename for each.

To check your current print control file for brand and model, edit or
type the file and look at the first line.

3. Know your printer port.
PC-Write and DOS assume the printer is plugged into the LPT1 or PAR1 port
(two names for the first parallel port).
If it is on the second parallel port (LPT2 or PAR2) or a serial port
(COM1, COM2, SER1, or SER2), you need to tell either PC-Write or DOS.

Redirect printing with PC-Write by using the .O Dot line. 
Edit the print control file. Add the line:
  .O:SER1   (Dot lines start with Alt G)

This directs all printing to the first serial port.
Replace SER1 with SER2 or PAR2 depending on the port in use.
The .O line may also be used in a text file to redirect single files.

Redirect printing with DOS by adding the following line to the DOS
file AUTOEXEC.BAT. Be sure to run AUTOEXEC.BAT before testing changes.
  MODE LPT1:=COM1

You can replace COM1 with COM2 or LPT2 (DOS doesn't use SERx or PARx).

4. If your computer sends text to your printer too fast the printer may hang
during printing, or output may be jumbled. You can send the file to the
printer with a delay by using one of these special PC-Write names:

  S<letter>D1   for a serial printer connected to COM1
  S<letter>D2   for a serial printer connected to COM2
  P<letter>D1   for a parallel printer connected to LPT1
  P<letter>D2   for a parallel printer connected to LPT2

The <letter> is from A to Z, A the shortest and Z the longest delay.
Each letter is twice the delay as the one before it. Experiment to
find one that works for you. Put the name in your print control file:
  .O:SGD2

S P E L L   C H E C K E R

The master word list WORDS.MAS comes on the PC-Write reference diskette.
Copy it to your working disk (or another disk if it doesn't fit).

You can create a custom user word list called WORDS.USE. You can merge the
words in WORDS.USE to WORDS.MAS with the program WORDS.EXE. To do this, have
WORDS.MAS, WORDS.USE, and WORDS.EXE on the default disk or directory. Type:
  WORDS <enter>   and follow the instructions.


Check spelling

Top Margin

Change the top margin with a .XT:length Dot line in the text file. The new
margin is counted when you repage a document with Alt F7, and will skip that
length from the top of the page when you print. If you have a dot matrix
printer, you may want to just position the printhead.

Bottom Margin

Change the bottom margin with a .XB:length Dot line in the text file. A change
in .XB is reflected when you repage, and printing stops the specified length
from the bottom of the page.

Left Margin

The simplest way to change the left margin is using .X:nn Dot line. .X lets
you specify how many extra spaces of left margin to print. The left margin
does not appear changed on screen, but when you print the document the text
will be printed at the new margin.

Sliding Text Left or Right

Another way to change the left margin:
1. Mark text with F3 or F6, or file with Ctl F5
2. For slide right press Shf Ins, for slide left press Shf Del
3. At prompt enter number of spaces to slide.

Ruler Left Margin

1. Press F2 to edit Ruler line
   Change old "L" to "M", add new "L".
   Change old "P" to "Q", add new "P".
2. Mark text with F3 or F6, or file with Ctl F5
2. Reformat with F7.

You can keep blocks of text or lines (addresses) from being reformatted with
Guide lines .- before and .+ after text.

See FORMATTING to center and flush right.


Right Margin

Ruler Change and Reformat
1. Press F2 to edit Ruler line
2. Move cursor to location of new right margin, enter right margin letter.
2. Reformat, as with Left Margin.

Turn on fonts and/or enhancements in one of three ways. Current font is
shown on the Status Line when editing. See STATUS LINE.

1. For a piece of text on a line, press Alt plus one of the letters listed
below before and after the text, or mark the text and select from the Font
Menu Alt F6, F6. Repeat for each line. Font characters do not print.
To view text on screen without Font characters press Alt Space Bar.
To see them again press Alt Space Bar again.

2. For longer blocks of text use .R:letter to start font or enhancement.
Use .Q:letter to stop a font or enhancement. See DOT LINES, PAGE LAYOUT.

3. You may set the font or enhancement in the Ruler separately for each column
by typing #letter into the Ruler line. See COLUMNS, RULER LINES.

Many fonts, when selected with a .R:letter command, change Ruler spacing.
For example, Elite and Quality set Ruler spacing to 12 characters per inch
(cpi), Double wide to 5 cpi, Compressed to 15 cpi. Pica, Fast, and Variable
set it to 10 cpi. Using Alt-letters does not affect Ruler spacing.

The following are the most common problems encountered, and the usual solutions.

Editing

1. Make sure the PC-Write program is all in one subdirectory
   or floppy disk, and it is the default drive and subdirectory.

2. Try PC-Write without any memory resident software (any program
   loaded into memory and active as you work with PC-Write).
   If you are on a network, run PC-Write locally.

   Memory resident software, network software, and the DOS APPEND command
   sometimes interfere with the DOS PATH command. This may cause PC-Write
   (and other programs) problems locating files.

3. If you suspect damage to a PC-Write file, recopy the file from the original
   diskettes, or make a new work diskette using WORKDISK with a new, blank,
   formatted diskette. On a hard disk system, use a new subdirectory.
   If these fail, try to run PC-Write from your original diskettes (not
   recommended in the ordinary case). If PC-Write will not run from your
   original diskettes, you may need a new set.

4. If changes to the edit control file ED.DEF do not appear to take effect,
   check for other ED.DEF files on the PATH and for ED.ext where .ext matches
   the extension of the file you are editing. Use the /w switch to check which
   control files have been read. Check the print control file (PR.DEF) for a
   line that may override one in ED.DEF. Return to DOS and reload the editor
   after changes to ED.DEF. See CONTROL FILES. Use the DOS command SET <enter>
   to look for a SET ED=  command. SET ED= is read, not ED.DEF.

Printing   (See PRINTER SETUP)
Printers have more problems than any other part of a computer system. If
your printer is not working with PC-Write, DON'T PANIC.

If the printer is not working or PC-Write tells you it cannot print, check:

1. Printer power is on. Turn the printer off and on to reset it.
2. Printer is activated, the "online" or "selected" light is on.
3. Printer has paper.
4. All plugs and cables are secure and fully plugged in.

5. All switches on your printer are set according to specifications.
   (Look in your printer manual.)

6. Printer is plugged into the correct port of your computer.
   (Parallel and serial ports often look the same. Many computers have both.)

7. If your printer is a serial printer, the output is redirected to a serial
   port with the DOS MODE command. If your serial printer uses XON/XOFF
   protocol (not PC-Write's normal) print to the special file SER1 or SER2.

8. The PrtScreen Key (Shf Grey*) will work if your printer is hooked up
   correctly.

9. Program file ED.EXE is on your working diskette or directory.

Check the PRINTER APPENDIX of the PC-Write User's Guide for a detailed list
of printers, known problems, and solutions for your specific printer.

If it is printing, but the results are incorrect, check that:

1. You have the right print control file installed as PR.DEF.
   The first line of the print control file lists brand and model.

2. If your printer has more than one emulation mode, the print control file
   matches the current emulation mode.

3. The type style or characters you want are in the character set(s) shown in
   your printer manual, in the current mode.

4. If you are printing one page at a time with cut sheet paper, you
   may need to disable your printer's "out of paper" switch.

5. Make sure that the top of the page is just at the printhead, so
   that if the printer were to print immediately, it would print in
   the first sixth of an inch of the paper.

If all else fails:

Print your file to another file, instead of to the printer, using F1, F7, Enter,
F9, filename, Enter. This file has everything normally sent to the printer
including escape sequences and printer codes. Edit this processed file with
PC-Write. You may see many strange looking symbols, but you should also see
your text. You may be able to print the processed file successfully using the
DOS PRINT command.

To switch from one file to another:
1. Press F1 then F6.

2. Type the filename you want to load. Press Enter. To load a file from a
   drive or directory that is not the default, be sure to type the drive
   and/or directory.

3. The file currently being edited is saved. The new file is loaded. You
   are prompted for a backup. Press Esc for no backup, or F9 if you want a
   backup copy. The new file appears on screen.


File and drive switching options after F1, F6:
Change prefix for files..........................F2
Change default drive for files...................F3
Change default directory for files...............F4
Quick switch to another file earlier/later in a
 series (eg. FILE1.T, FILE2.T, FILE3.T, etc.)....F5/F7
Display directory, select file to edit...........F8
Switch to filename at the cursor.................F6
Switch to file, with backup......................F9
Switch to file, no for backup....................F10
Switch to file, prompt for backup................Enter

Import text from one file to another by marking text, switching files,
and then inserting the text with F3, F6, or Ctl F4.

Creating Columns

1. Press F2 to bring up the Ruler line.
2. Place the cursor at the left margin of the 1st column. Type a left margin
   letter, like "L".
3. Move the cursor to the right margin of the 1st column. Type a right
   margin letter, like "J" or "R".
4. Move the cursor to where you want the column division and type "V". Space
   between R and V does not print. Put the V at least 4 spaces after the R.
   For a proportional font, place the V at twice the R spacing.
5. For each additional column, type another set of left, right, and "V"
   margin letters in the Ruler line. To do columns easily, give each column
   the same margins. Embed the Ruler line by pressing F4.

Column Ruler example:
  ---L----------------R---V--L----------------R---V--L----------------R---V


Breaking Columns

Columns break at:
Column-Break line (Alt F6 then F10 then F8)
Ruler line with different V margins
Ruler line with "(" or ")"

Columns Don't Break at:
Ruler line with same V margins
Hard Page Break
Soft Page Break


Moving Around Columns

The cursor keys stay within their columns, except:
Shf Home         At start of column, moves to left margin of prior column
Shf End          At end of column, moves to the end of the next column
Shf Up/Dn Arrow  Jump to top/bottom of column, stopping at Ruler lines
                   or any Dot line that breaks the column
Lt/Rt Arrow      Ignore column boundaries
Shf Lt/Rt Arrow  Stop at column boundaries as well as edges of the screen
Ctl/Shf Ctl Tab  Scroll horizontally by columns (extended keyboards only)



Inserting and Deleting Lines in a Column

Enter            Inserts a blank line in a column
Shf Enter        Inserts a line across all columns
Ctl Enter        Deletes from cursor to the end of column
Del              At end of line in column, join with next line
Shf Ctl Bksp     Deletes from the cursor to the start of the current column
Shf Ctl Enter    Deletes a whole line across all columns
Ctl F4           Undeletes text deleted with Ctl Enter or Shf Ctl Enter

Setting the Font for a Column

To set a font for a column, type #font letter on the Ruler between "L" and "V".
  --L-------#f---------R----V--L-------#p---------R----V


Reformatting a Paragraph in a Column

Merge All Records Automatically
1. Press Shf F3, F10. F6 stops merge.

Note: After merging, you can edit Output file, then print it.

The Input File contains the information (records) to be merged with your letter,
form, or labels. Create an Input file with PC-Write or export one from a data
base program. PC-Write accepts 3 Input file formats:

Separate line    Each field on a separate line
Comma-separated  Each record on a line, each field separated by a comma
Fixed-length     Every field contains a fixed number of characters

When creating an Input file:
* A field can be empty.
  In separate line format, leave empty line.
  In comma-separated format, leave extra comma.
  In fixed-length format, leave blanks.
* Every record must have same number of fields.
* The Input file can have any number of records.
* Maximum Input field length is 255 characters.

The Template File consists of 3 parts:

Input template: describes the Input file format. List every field name
(letters only) in the record, each one on a separate line in one of the formats:

Type of field            Format               Example
Separate line field      {fieldname}          {name}
Comma-separated field    {fieldname,}         {city,}
Fixed length field       {fieldname:length}   {code:10}

Template divider: is {} between the Output and Input templates.

Output template: contains the text to be duplicated and the field variables
that specify where to place the text from the Input file. A field variable is
a field name from the Input template surrounded by curly braces, like {name}.
Field variables should not contain commas or field lengths.


Input template options                  Format               Example
To keep leading blanks                  # before field name  {#city,}
To keep trailing blanks                 # after field name   {name#,}
To assign default text for empty field  = after last brace   {num}= unknown
For prompt at empty field               ? after last brace   {name}?Enter name

Output template options                 Format                    Example
To align field variable text left       < before field variable   {<name}
To align field variable text right      > before field variable   {>city}
To reformat during the merge            + after field variable    {address+}
To delete a line if field is empty      - after field variable    {address2-}
To delete a line if field is empty,     / after field variable    {address3/}
 adding a blank line to end of Output

A Ruler Line is a guideline that sets paragraph margins and indents, tabs,
and column boundaries. It can also set a bell, reformatting on or off, decimal
tabs, ruler spacing, and column font. A Ruler Line starts with an invisible
Alt-G, and contains capital letters used by PC-Write, and lower case letters, 
dashes and so on for your own reference. For Ruler letters and options:
ENHANCING TEXT, MARGINS, MEASURING, PAGE LAYOUT, PARAGRAPH STYLES, REFORMATTING

A default Ruler is in the edit control file (ED.DEF). You can also EMBED a Ruler
in a text file, or in your own edit control files. The current Ruler is the most
recent embedded Ruler, or (if none) the most recently read control file.

Display the current Ruler line and the Window/Ruler Menu with F2.
The Default Ruler Line is the last Ruler line in the edit control file.
The Current Ruler Line is the most recent Ruler, embedded or in a control file.

Ruler Line Options:
F2         Display/remove current Ruler line.
F2, F4     Embed current Ruler into text; saved with file, doesn't print.
F2, F6     Read a Ruler from a control file.
F2, Grey+  Make the next Ruler line in the text the current Ruler.
F2, Grey-  Make the prior Ruler line in the text the current Ruler.

You can edit an embedded Ruler as text, or press F2 at or below it to edit in
Ruler mode. To embed a modified version of a Ruler:
1. Press F2.
2. Find the Ruler you want with Grey-.
3. Press F4 to embed it.
4. Press F2 again to edit in Ruler mode.
5. Edit the Ruler, either as text or in Ruler mode.

Mini-Rulers are just an Alt-G  followed by a right margin letter.
They only change the right margin in use.

Example:
L---+--T-1----+T---2---T+----3-T--+----4-------T-5----+T----6--T-+----7T--+--R
C

this mini-ruler has the same effect as:

L---+--T-1----+T---2---T+----3-T--+----4-------T-5----+T----6--T-+----7T--+--C

You might use the Mini-Ruler to center a title over text using the current
Ruler by placing a "C" Mini-Ruler above the title, and a "R" Mini-Ruler below
the title to return to a ragged right margin for the body of the text.

The Width of your text is measured in Ruler spacing. Leading spaces (between
the column or screen start and the text) print at the Ruler line position.
Normally Ruler line spacing is the width of the current font. For example:

.R:E
L---+--T-1----+T---2---T+----3-T--+----4-------T-5----+T----6--T-+----7T--+--R

changes the Regular font to Elite, a 12 character per inch (cpi) font, so Ruler
spacing changes to 12 cpi too. Variable width fonts set 10 cpi Ruler spacing.
If you change width fonts often in a file you should place a Ruler spacing
command (@10i, @12i, etc.) in the Ruler line to standardize width measuring.

If your computer has enough memory you may temporarily exit PC-Write to run
another program or a DOS command, while the editor and your document stay in
the computer's memory. You can clip text from other program's screens.

Exiting PC-Write to the Shell
1. Press F1 to bring up the System/Help Menu.
2. Press F4.  The top line reads:
     Command file (Esc:cancel F8:dir): "drive:\COMMAND.COM"
   where "drive" is the boot drive.
3. Press Enter to do a DOS command, or type the name of the .COM or .EXE
   file to execute. PC-Write looks first for a .COM, then for a.EXE file.
4. When the DOS command has been run the computer screen looks as if
   you are at DOS, and displays the DOS prompt.

Reentering PC-Write, Exiting the Shell
1. When you run a program directly from PC-Write, and the program finishes,
   you are prompted with:
     To return to the edit program, press any key
2. Or, if at the DOS prompt in the shell type:
     EXIT <Enter>.

Notes: The shell from PC-Write is a temporary opening to DOS. When you return
the shell is closed and all activities ended. So, the shell is suitable for
applications that will be complete when you return to PC-Write, but not for
loading a memory resident program that you wish to stay active upon return to
PC-Write. To load a resident program, exit PC-Write normally (F1, F2), load the
program, and then reenter the editor (ED filename).



SCREEN CLIP lets you mark a box of text on the screen of another program and
place it in the hold area. Later you can insert the text by inserting the
Hold Area into your file.

To Screen Clip
1. Press Shf Ctl F5 to clear the Hold Area.
2. Enter the DOS shell as shown above with F1, F4, <Enter>.
3. Run the program until the text you want to copy to PC-Write is on screen.
4. Press Shf Ctl F6. Move to one corner of the box you want to copy.
5. Press Shf Ctl F6 again. Move to the opposite corner of the box to copy.
6. Press Shf Ctl F6 a third time to copy the box to the end of Hold Area.
7. Return to PC-Write, as shown above with Exit at DOS, or <Enter> at the
   return to edit prompt.
8. In the PC-Write file, Press Ctl F4 to insert Hold Area at the cursor.
