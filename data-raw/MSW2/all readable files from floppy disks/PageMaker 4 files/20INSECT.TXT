ORDER INSECTIVORA
COMMENTS: Formerly included elephant shrews and tree
     shrews which, since Butler (1972) are placed in
     two separate orders, Macroscelidea and Scandentia.
     Reviewed by Cabrera (1925). Phylogeny of living
     and fossil insectivores treated by Van Valen
     (1967). For basic data on brain structure and
     evolution see Stephan et al. (1991). For a
     synopsis of karyotype data see Reumer and Meylan

Solenodon Brandt, 1833. Mem. Acad. Imp. Sci., St.
     Petersbourg, ser. 6, 2:459.
TYPE SPECIES: Solenodon paradoxus Brandt, 1833.
SYNONYMS: Antillogale, Atopogale. 
COMMENTS: Includes Antillogale and Atopogale; see
     Patterson (1962:2) and Varona (1974:6). Besides
     the two extant species, two presumably extinct
     species have been described from Cuba ("Giant
     Solenodon") and Hispaniola (Antillogale marcanoi
     Patterson, 1962); see Morgan and Woods (1986).
     Remains of Solenodon marcanoi have been found in a
     horizon of "Late Pleistocene or Recent" age
     (Patterson, 1962).

Family Nesophontidae Anthony, 1916. Bull. Am. Mus. Nat.
     Hist., 35:725.
COMMENTS: Known only from sub-Recent fossils from the
     Greater Antilles. One genus with eight taxa have
     been named, of which Hall (1981) listed six as
     valid species. Morgan and Woods (1986) recognized
     eight species. Recent efforts to locate surviving
     populations have been unsuccessful (Woods et al.,

COMMENTS: All species of Nesophontes appear to have
     survived the late Pleistocene extinction, at least
     five species are known to have existed into post
     Columbian times, and several species apparently
     did not go extinct until the early part of this
     century (Morgan and Woods, 1986). Includes an
     undescribed species from the Cayman Isls which was
     found in post-Columbian deposits (Morgan and
     Woods, 1986; Varona, 1974).

     Simonetta (1968:31) regarded it as a synonym of
     Carpitalpa. He placed arendsi, stuhlmanni and
     fosteri in Carpitalpa and tropicalis in
     Chlorotalpa. Lamotte and Petter (1981) described
     balsaci from Mt. Oku, Cameroon, a form which may
     deserve full specific status. Also the isolated
     tropicalis should be re- studied.

     golden, and Corbet and Hill (1991:27) suggested
     "spiny moonrat" as a common name. Heaney and
     Morgan (1982) considered that generic rank might
     be justified for this species but decided to
     include it in Podogymnura in order to emphasize
     the close relationship between the two species of
     Philippine gymnures; see also Corbet
     (1988:130-131).

Family Soricidae G. Fischer, 1817. Mem. Soc. Imp. Nat.
     Moscow, 5:372.
SYNONYMS: Heterosoricidae. 
COMMENTS: Revised by Repenning (1967) and Gureev (1971,
     1979). For conflicting views of phylogeny, see
     Jammot (1983), George (1986), and Reumer (1987).
     Geological age currently believed to be Miocene,
     but recently the genera Cretasorex (Nesov and
     Gureev, 1981) from the Upper Cretaceous of
     Uzbekistan and Ernosorex (Wang and Li, 1990) from
     the Eocene of China have been assigned to this
     family; while the former clearly represents a
     shrew the latter does not and may be a member of
     Plesiosoricidae. Currently accepted limits of
     subfamilies and tribes are very tentative. Most
     authors do not follow Reumer (1987) and include
     the extinct Heterosoricinae as a subfamily
     (Engesser, 1975; Storch and Qiu, 1991), a view
     also accepted here. As a consequence, all living
     shrews as the sister group of Heterosoricidae
     should be classified in a single subfamily
     Soricinae, with Soricini and Crocidurini as
     tribes. However, as a convincing new phylogenetic
     system of fossil and living shrews has not yet
     been elaborated and as the application of two
     extant subfamilies proposed by Repenning (1967) is
     very much in use, it is provisionally applied here
     until new evidence has been presented.

Subfamily Crocidurinae Milne-Edwards, 1872. Rech. Hist.
     Nat. Mammifres, p. 256.
SYNONYMS: Crocidosoricinae, Myosoricinae. 
COMMENTS: Perhaps not a monophyletic group. Reumer
     (1987) postulated a new subfamily,
     Crocidosoricinae, for a number of fossil genera
     previously included in Crocidurinae. By
     application of the characters given for the new
     clade, a number of recent genera such as
     Congosorex, Myosorex and Surdisorex would go with
     it. The entire group is in need of revision.

STATUS: Listed by IUCN as Extinct, but this is
     incorrect.
COMMENTS: Type species of subgenus Praesorex Thomas,
     1913. Often included in flavescens or olivieri,
     but apparently represents a distinct species which
     lives in sympatry with C. olivieri in the Central
     African forest; see Hutterer (in Colyn, 1986:22).

Crocidura gueldenstaedtii (Pallas, 1811). Zoogr.

TYPE LOCALITY: Georgia, near Dushet (N of Tbilisi).
DISTRIBUTION: Transcaucasia.
SYNONYMS: aralychensis, bogdanowii, fumigatus,
     longicaudata. 
COMMENTS: This name has produced much confusion.
     Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1966) listed it as a
     subspecies of russula and were followed by Corbet
     (1978c), among others. Richter (1970) applied
     gueldenstaedtii even to Mediterranean populations
     of suaveolens and was followed in that action by
     Kahmann and Vesmanis (1976). Hutterer (1981d)
     suggested that all these populations represent
     suaveolens; this was supported by karyological and
     biochemical data (Catzeflis et al., 1985). Despite
     convincing evidence some Russian authors (e.g.,
     Grafodatsky et al., 1988) still claim the
     existence of gueldenstaedtii as a species in the
     Caucasus. This species is almost certainly
     conspecific with suaveolens.

     distinct species; the latter may well be
     separable. C. bloyeti, formerly listed as a
     species, is included here because it was based on
     a juvenile hirta. The Angolan erica may also
     belong here.

Crocidura nana Dobson, 1890. Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser.
     6, 5:225.
TYPE LOCALITY: Somalia, Dollo.
DISTRIBUTION: Somalia, Ethiopia.
COMMENTS: The name nana has been applied to various
     small shrews of Somalia, Ethiopia, and Egypt,
     leading to the proposal (Setzer, 1957) that nana
     is conspecific with religiosa (which it does not
     antedate); a conclusion followed by Heim de Balsac
     and Mein (1971) and Osborn and Helmy (1980).
     Personal examination of the holotype of nana
     revealed that it represents a juvenile (skull
     inside the skin) of a species larger that
     religiosa; this conclusion was supported by better
     preserved topotypical specimens from Somalia in
     the British Museum (Natural History), which were
     also compared with the neotype of religiosa
     (Corbet, 1978c:27). The proposed conspecificy is
     therefore not accepted, and religiosa remains an
     endemic of the Nile valley in Egypt. The relation
     of nana with other small species has yet to be
     studied.

     which were listed as separate species by Heim de
     Balsac and Meester (1977) and Dippenaar and
     Meester (1989); see Hutterer et al. (1987b). The
     holotypes of nigrofusca, luluae and zaodon have

TYPE LOCALITY: Guinea, Mt. Nimba, montane prairie.
DISTRIBUTION: Sierra Leone to Ivory Coast; possibly
     Nigeria.
COMMENTS: Described with some doubt as a subspecies of
     bottegi, but its almost sympatric distribution, a
     longer skull (Hutterer and Happold, 1983), and a
     different karyotype (Maddalena, pers. comm.)
     clearly distinguish it. 

Crocidura olivieri (Lesson, 1827). Manuel de
     Mammalogie, p. 121.
TYPE LOCALITY: Egypt, Sakkara; the neotype designated
     by Corbet (1978c:30) was collected "near Giza".
DISTRIBUTION: Egypt; Senegal to Ethiopia, and
     southwards to N South Africa.
SYNONYMS: anchietae, atlantis, bueae, cara, daphnia,
     darfurea, deltae, ferruginea, fuscosa, giffardi,
     guineensis, doriana, hansruppi, hedenborgiana,
     hera, herero, kijabae, kivu, luluana, manni,
     martiensseni, nyansae, occidentalis, odorata,
     spurelli, sururae, tatiana, toritensis, zuleika.
COMMENTS: Crocidura olivieri is the valid name for the
     large African shrews previously known as
     flavescens (which is now the valid name for a
     species restricted to South Africa); see Maddalena
     et al. (1987). This group of giant shrews was
     reviewed by Heim de Balsac and Barloy (1966). Well
     known subspecies names are anchietae, doriana,
     ferruginea, fuscosa, giffardi, guineensis,
     hansruppi, hedenborgiana, kivu, manni,
     martiensseni, nyansae, occidentalis, odorata,
     spurelli, and sururae. Some of these were
     considered allospecies of a flavescens
     superspecies by Hutterer and Happold (1983). Many
     authors also distinguished pale (occidentalis,
     manni, spurelli) and black (giffardi,
     hedenborgiana, martiensseni, odorata) color morphs
     as different species but biochemical evidence
     showed that they are merely color morphs of a
     single and highly variable species (Maddalena,
     1990). Crocidura olivieri may also include
     zaphiri; see Yalden et al. (1976).

COMMENTS: Provisionally included in dsinezumi (Corbet,
     1978c); but regarded as a separate species by
     Imaizumi (1961, 1970b), Abe (1967), and Jenkins
     (1976). The species was first described by Kuroda
     (1924) in a publication which, although privately

COMMENTS: Some authors have included armenica,
     serezkyensis, and zarudnyi (see Spitzenberger,
     1971, and Corbet, 1978c, for a review of
     literature); but all are now considered separate
     species. A considerable diversity of opinions
     exists in the literature on the allocation of the
     different forms. Following Jenkins (1976), the
     name pergrisea is applied only to the largest
     species, as represented by the type series from
     Baltistan.

TYPE LOCALITY: Kashmir, Kotihar, 7,000 ft.
DISTRIBUTION: Kashmir, India, Afghanistan, Pakistan,
     Yunnan (China), Thailand, full range unknown.
SYNONYMS: rapax, vorax. 
COMMENTS: The name pullata is provisonally used as a
     label to include the Asian populations of what has
     been called russula by Jenkins (1976) and many
     other authors. It can be seen from the
     measurements provided by Jameson and Jones (1977)
     that the forms pullata, rapax and vorax differ
     from the European russula by a longer tail; all
     have been assigned to the West European species;
     see Lekagul and McNeely (1977), among others.

Crocidura raineyi Heller, 1912. Smithson. Misc. Coll.

TYPE LOCALITY: Kenya, "North Creek, Mt. Garguez".
DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality.
STATUS: IUCN - Insufficiently known.
COMMENTS: Since its description C. raineyi has been
     considered a valid species, but was synonymized in
     1977 with C. luna, an error recently corrected by
     Dippenaar and Meester (1989).

     poliogastra, pulchra, rufa, safii, thoracicus,
     unicolor, yebalensis. 
COMMENTS: Reviewed by Genoud and Hutterer (1990). The
     species is confined to W Europe and N Africa. Many
     populations from Asia and even Africa have been
     erroneously assigned to russula (see Ellermann and
     Morrison-Scott, 1951). Allozyme and karyotype
     analyses by Catzeflis et al. (1985) have shown
     that animals from E Europe, Asia Minor and Israel
     formerly identified as russula instead belong to
     suaveolens. This may also be true for other
     populations further east. Does not include
     hosletti, rapax, or vorax (see Ellerman and
     Morrison-Scott, 1966:81; Jameson and Jones,
     1977:465), which are here included in dsinezumi
     and pullata, respectively. May include
     cossyrensis; see under that species.

     Sarezskoye.
DISTRIBUTION: Asia Minor, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan,
     Tadshikistan and Kazakhstan.
SYNONYMS: arispa. 
COMMENTS: Previously included in pergrisea
     (Spitzenberger, 1971; Jenkins, 1976), but
     considered a distinct species by Stogov and Bondar
     (1966) and Stogov (1985). Populations in Asia
     Minor (arispa Spitzenberger, 1971) are linked with
     the typical ones in Kazakhstan and Tadshikistan by
     records from Azerbaijan (Grafodatsky et al., 1988)
     and Turkmenistan (Stogov and Bondar, 1966).
     Grafodatsky et al. (1988) reported on the
     karyotype of a specimen from Dzhulfa, SW
     Azerbaijan (under the name pergrisea); with 2n=22
     serezkyensis has the lowest chromosome number ever
     recorded for a shrew.

TYPE LOCALITY: Italy, Sicily, Palermo.
DISTRIBUTION: Sicily, Egadi Isls (Italy) and Gozo
     (Malta).
SYNONYMS: aegatensis, calypso, caudata, esuae. 
COMMENTS: Revised by Hutterer (1991), who recognized
     one extinct and three extant subspecies. Formerly
     included in leucodon, russula, or suaveolens; but
     the species has a distinct karyotype (Vogel, 1988)
     and morphology (Vogel et al., 1989).

     also include mutesae and suahelae (here
     questionably listed in viaria), in which case it
     would be a widely distributed species; see
     Hutterer and Yalden (1990:70).

Crocidura zarudnyi Ognev, 1928. [Mammals of Eastern
     Europe and Northern Asia], 1:341.
TYPE LOCALITY: Iran, Baluchistan (border).
DISTRIBUTION: SE Iran, SE Afghanistan, SW Pakistan
     (Spitzenberger, 1971).
SYNONYMS: streetorum, tatianae. 
COMMENTS: The species was first named tatianae by Ognev
     (1921), but later (1828) replaced by zarudnyi;
     Ognev argued that tatianae was preoccupied by
     tatiana Dollman, 1915 (now a synonym of the
     African olivieri). Strictly following the
     International Code of Zoological Nomenclature
     (1985, art. 58), this is not the case, and
     zarudnyi would be an unjustified replacement name.
     However, since the species has always been called
     zarudnyi it would be justified to present the case
     to the commission in favor of stability. The
     definition of zarudnyi follows Spitzenberger
     (1971) and Hassinger (1970), but not Jenkins
     (1976) who included arispa which is now regarded
     as part of serezkyensis; see under that species.
     As Spitzenberger (1971) pointed out, zarudnyi has
     a shorter rostrum and a heavier mandible than both
     pergrisea and serezkyensis. The status of
     streetorum is not clear although it is included
     here as suggested by Hassinger (1970). The
     distribution and morphology of pergrisea,
     serezkyensis, and zarudnyi should be carefully
     studied in the Hindukush, Karakoram and Pamir
     where their ranges may overlap.

Myosorex Gray, 1838. Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1837:124
     [1838].
TYPE SPECIES: Sorex varius Smuts, 1832.
COMMENTS: Subfamily status uncertain. Repenning (1967)
     grouped Myosorex in the Crocidurinae; Reumer's
     (1987) Crocidosoricinae would fit as well. Kretzoi
     (1965) based the tribe Myosoricini on this genus;
     the name is available for any taxonomic unit above
     the genus level. Generic status sometimes
     questioned; but see Meester (1954). Surdisorex and
     Congosorex are often included as subgenera but are
     treated here as full genera, following Thomas
     (1906b), Hollister (1918), Meester (1953), Heim de
     Balsac (1966b), and my own studies. Partial
     reviews of Myosorex were provided by Heim de
     Balsac (1967, 1968b), Heim de Balsac and Lamotte
     (1956), and Meester and Dippenaar (1978). The
     formerly listed Myosorex preussi (Matschie, 1893),
     described from "Mount Cameroun", is not listed
     here, because a recent examination of the type
     series has shown that the type series was based on
     mismatched parts of three different genera
     (Crocidura, Sorex, Sylvisorex), and that preussi
     does not represent a biological species. Species
     of conservation concern are listed in Nicoll and
     Rathbun (1990:21).

SYNONYMS: swinnyi. 
COMMENTS: Meester (1958) described the geographic
     variation of the species. Heim de Balsac and
     Meester (1977) included affinis, sclateri,
     swinnyi, talpinus and tenuis in cafer, while
     Wolhuter (in Smithers, 1983:3) and Dippenaar et
     al. (1983) regarded sclateri and tenuis as
     distinct, partly based on new karyotype
     information. Although no additonal data have yet
     been published, this view is provisionally
     accepted here as it better reflects existing
     variation within the southern African
     representatives of the genus.

     Balsac (1968b) himself was uncertain about the
     status of this taxon; while he formally named it
     M. eisentrauti rumpii, he labeled all figures and
     the map with "Myosorex rumpii".

     17:124.
TYPE LOCALITY: Sri Lanka, Central Province, Ohiya, West
     Haputale Estate (6,000 ft.).
DISTRIBUTION: Central highlands of Sri Lanka.
COMMENTS: Although usually included in S. etruscus,
     this taxon represents a species endemic to Sri
     Lanka. Podihik kura Deraniyagala, 1958, which was
     included in this species by Phillips (1980), does
     not represent fellowesgordoni, but is more similar
     to etruscus.

DISTRIBUTION: Malaysian peninsula.
COMMENTS: Commonly included in etruscus but inhabits
     tropical forest and does not fit morphologically
     with the diagnosis of that species; malayanus is
     therefore regarded as a species, as was done by
     Corbet and Hill (1991:36).

COMMENTS: A very variable species with a number of
     genetically distinct populations which almost
     behave like semispecies (Hasler et al., 1977;
     Yamagata et al., 1987; Yoshida, 1985). A number of
     laboratory strains have been established (Oda et
     al., 1985). Much of the present distribution is
     the result of human agency (Hutterer and Tranier,
     1990). Includes albicauda, auriculata,
     crassicaudus, duvernoyi, leucura, mauritiana,
     sacer, and geoffroyi; see Heim de Balsac and

     14:313.
TYPE LOCALITY: Sri Lanka, "Gonagama Estate, Kitulgala,
     900 ft."
DISTRIBUTION: Higlands of Sri Lanka.
COMMENTS: Phillips (1980) stressed that zeylanicus
     differs distinctly from murinus in the flesh,
     particularly by its long and almost naked tail,
     and that it lives in primary forest. However, its
     relation to montanus has still to be studied.

Surdisorex Thomas, 1906. Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7,

COMMENTS: Included in genus Myosorex and regarded as a
     subspecies of norae by Heim de Balsac and Meester
     (1977); however, both species form a quite
     distinct clade. For ecology and distribution see

TYPE SPECIES: Crocidura morio Gray, 1862.
COMMENTS: Subfamily Crocidurinae; see Repenning
     (1967:15). The genus was regarded as part of
     Suncus by Smithers and Tello (1976), but was
     retained by Ansell (1978); it may be polyphyletic
     and its relation to Suncus requires further study.

COMMENTS: S. megalua is the most common species of the
     genus, and enters forested savannas; range mapped
     by Hutterer et al. (1987b). Gureev (1979:381)
     listed sorella as a distinct species without
     comment. Some geographic variation exists, the
     Central African forest populations being smallest
     and darkest.

Subfamily Soricinae G. Fischer, 1817. Mem. Soc. Imp.
     Nat. Moscow, 5:372.
COMMENTS: The recognition of two subfamilies within the
     Soricidae is mainly based on Repenning (1967), and
     has been widely accepted; see George (1986), but
     see also comments under family. Reumer (1984)
     modified the tribal subdivision. Work in progress,
     however, raises doubt on the validity of current
     concepts.

COMMENTS: Included in quadraticauda by Ellerman and
     Morrison-Scott (1951) and subsequent authors, but
     the species has a much smaller and narrower skull
     (see measurements in Hoffmann, 1987:134) and is
     therefore regarded as distinct. Differences were
     also recognized by Corbet (1978c:26).

Chimarrogale Anderson, 1877. J. Asiat. Soc. Bengal,

TYPE SPECIES: Crossopus himalayicus Gray, 1842.
SYNONYMS: Chimmarogale, Crossogale. 
COMMENTS: Tribe Neomyini; see Repenning (1967:61).
     Because of the presence of white teeth the genus
     was occasionally included in subfamily
     Crocidurinae, but since Repenning (1967),
     overwhelming evidence has been accumulated showing
     that Chimarrogale is a soricine shrew (Vogel and
     Besancon, 1979; Mori et al., 1991). Gureev
     (1971:226) included Chimarrogale in his subtribe
     Nectogalina within the Blarinini, while Reumer
     (1984:14) included it in the tribe Soriculini; see
     comments under genus Neomys. Includes Crossogale;
     see Harrison (1958), who also revised the genus.
     His arrangement was found to be more realistic
     than the present practice of lumping all forms
     together in one or two species.

DISTRIBUTION: Tropical forest of the Malaysian
     peninsula.
COMMENTS: Included in himalayica by Medway (1977) and
     other authors but retained by Jones and Mumford
     (1971). The species differs considerably in its
     morphology and ecology from the species which
     inhabit the Himalayan region. The photograph of a

     Jones and Mumford (1971) maintained styani and

COMMENTS: Type genus of Soricidae. The systematic
     relationships of a large number of Holarctic
     species were studied by George (1988); her
     proposals for subgeneric allocation are mainly
     followed here. Keys and/or reviews are available
     for the species of various geographical areas:
     Canada (van Zyll de Jong, 1983a); North and Middle
     America (Junge and Hoffmann, 1981; Carraway,
     1990); China (Hoffmann, 1987); Siberia (Yudin,
     1989); and Europe (Niethammer and Krapp, 1990).
     Microsorex was formerly regarded as a full genus,
     then reduced to a subgenus of Sorex by Diersing
     (1980b), and is now regarded as a synonym of
     subgenus Otisorex (see George, 1988). The subgenus
     Amphisorex (type species Sorex hermanni Duvernoy,
     1834) was alternatively listed under Sorex and
     Neomys by Miller (1912a), Ellermann and
     Morrison-Scott (1951), and Corbet (1978c). Miller
     (1912a) stated that the type of Sorex hermanni
     consisted of a skin of Sorex araneus and a skull
     of Neomys fodiens. To avoid further confusion, I
     herewith designate the skin of Sorex hermanni
     Duvernoy, 1834 as the lectotype, thus making
     hermanni a synonym of araneus, and Amphisorex a
     synonym of Sorex. Besides subgenera a number of
     species groups have been distinguished such as the
     araneus-arcticus group (Meylan and Hausser, 1973;
     Hausser et al., 1985), the cinereus group (van
     Zyll de Jong, 1991b), and the vagrans group
     (Carraway, 1990), the boundaries and contents of
     which are still highly controversial. Old World
     species of Sorex were reviewed by Dannelid (1991b)
     who provided a phylogenetic hypothesis of
     relationships.

     the preferred Palearctic species for studies in
     ecology and evolution; see Hausser et al. (1990)
     and Hausser (1991) for reviews. The species is
     well known for its Robertsonian chromosome
     polymorphism (Meylan, 1964) and for the tendency
     to establish local karyotype races (Hausser et
     al., 1985; Searle, 1984; Zima and Kr l, 1984b); in
     Switzerland, two karyotype races occur which
     behave like parapatric species (Hausser et al.,
     1986). Includes Blarina pyrrhonota Jentink, 1910,
     a name assigned to Cryptotis surinamensis by
     Cabrera (1958); however, Husson (1963) showed that
     the locality information was incorrect and that it
     was based on a Sorex araneus. The holotype skin
     (skull lost) of Sylvisorex preussi Matschie,
     formerly thought to represent an endemic Myosorex
     of Mt. Cameroon (Heim de Balsac, 1968b), is a
     Sorex araneus and is therefore included as a
     synonym. Sorex isodon marchicus, recently
     described from E Germany (Passarge, 1984), is also
     tentatively included in araneus as no clear
     characters are known to distinguish it from the
     latter.

COMMENTS: Subgenus Otisorex. There is some discrepancy
     in the literature on the correct name for this

     because of an apparently incorrect type locality
     information and further inconsistencies in the
     original description, Hoffmann and Peterson (1967)
     proposed to suppress hydrodromus in favour of
     pribilofensis Merriam, 1895, a suggestion followed
     by van Zyll de Jong (1991b). However, Yudin
     (1969), Baranova et al. (1981), Hall (1981), Junge

     Rossolimo (1987:15) to "Krasnoyarskii kr.,
     Krasnoyarsk." According to Ellerman and
     Morrison-Scott (1951:47), Linnaeus' name is based
     on Laxmann's ms. of Sibir. Briefe, and the type
     locality is Barnaul, Russia.
DISTRIBUTION: Europe to Yenesei River and Lake Baikal,
     south to Altai and Tien Shan Mtns; populations of
     Nepal and China have been alternatively identified
     as minutus or thibetanus; populations of Turkey
     and the Caucasus as minutus or volnuchini;
     populations of Kashmir and N Pakistan as minutus,
     planiceps, or thibetanus.

SYNONYMS: kutscheruki. 
COMMENTS: Placed in monotypic subgenus Ognevia by
     Heptner and Dolgov (1967), who demonstrated that
     mirabilis is not conspecific with pacificus, as
     had been suggested earlier (Bobrinskii et al.,
     1965). Hutterer (1982b) suggested a closer
     relationship with Sorex (Homalurus) alpinus
     because of shared derived features of genital
     morphology.

Sorex thibetanus Kastschenko, 1905. Izv. Tomsk. Univ.,
     27:93.
TYPE LOCALITY: "Tsaidam" [NE Tibet].
DISTRIBUTION: Himalyas and NE Tibet.
COMMENTS: The pygmy shrews of the Himalayas are the
     subject of controversy. The original description
     of thibetanus (as a subspecies of minutus) is not
     very helpful and the holotype in the Tomsk Academy
     was considered to be lost (Yudin, pers. comm. 1977
     to the author); Hutterer (1979) therefore regarded
     thibetanus as a nomen dubium. Dolgov and Hoffmann
     (1977) and later Hoffmann (1987) used thibetanus
     to define a Himalayan species in which they
     included buchariensis, kozlovi, planiceps, and
     specimens from Nepal and China reported as minutus
     by various authors. Hutterer (1979) instead
     recognized three species, buchariensis, planiceps,
     and minutus as occurring in the Himalayas and
     regarded kozlovi and thibetanus as indeterminable.
     Zaitsev (1988) pointed out differences between
     buchariensis and thibetanus. Surprisingly, the
     holotype of thibetanus turned up in the Zoological
     Museum of Moscow (Baranova et al., 1981) and
     Hoffmann (1987) reported on its measurements.
     These did not solve the problem but instead
     matched well with minutus. The controversy still
     remains unresolved and can be solved presumably
     only with new material and a more complete data
     set. Provisionally all the mentioned forms are
     listed separately.

COMMENTS: Subgenus Sorex. Youngman (1975) provided
     evidence that tundrensis is specifically distinct
     from arcticus. Palearctic populations formerly
     referred to arcticus were included in tundrensis
     by Junge et al. (1983). Hoffmann (1987) and van
     Zyll de Jong (1991b) discussed additional aspects
     of its taxonomy and distribution. Kozlovskii
     (1976) found irkutensis and sibiriensis to be
     karyotypically distinct; possibly two sibling
     species occur throughout the Palearctic range.

     to regard volnuchini as a full species. The
     karyotype of S. buchariensis is very similar
     (Ivanitskaya et al., 1977). Morphologically,
     volnuchini is not distinguishable from minutus;

Soriculus Blyth, 1854. J. Asiatic Soc. Bengal, 23:733.
TYPE SPECIES: Corsira nigrescens Gray, 1842.
SYNONYMS: Chodsigoa, Episoriculus. 
COMMENTS: Subfamily Soricinae, tribe Neomyini; see
     Repenning (1967:45). Reumer (1984:14) claimed that
     Soriculini Kretzoi, 1965, has priority over
     Neomyini Repenning, 1965, however, Neomyini
     Matschie, 1909, has priority over both. Includes
     Chodsigoa and Episoriculus as subgenera; see
     Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) and Corbet
     (1978c:24); but also see Repenning (1967:52) and
     Jameson and Jones (1977:474-475), who considered
     Episoriculus a distinct genus. Gureev
     (1979:450-452) erroneously listed Chodsigoa as a
     subgenus of Notiosorex. Genus reviewed by Hoffmann
     (1985b).

SYNONYMS: Desmanidae. 
COMMENTS: Subfamily systematics very provisional.
     Cabrera (1925) proposed a division into five
     subfamilies, three of which are applied here,
     following Yates (1984), among others. Scalopinae
     and Condylurinae are tentatively treated as
     tribes, following Hutchison (1968). Desmana and
     Galemys are sometimes placed in a separate family,
     Desmanidae; see Bobrinskii et al. (1965). Family
     reviewed by Gureev (1979); see also Gorman and
     Stone (1990). Relationships of recent moles

     see Hutchison (1968) and Storch and Qiu (1983).
     Some of these are sometimes regarded as
     subfamilies; see comments under family. Generic
     and specific limits are highly controversial,

     included Euroscaptor, Parascaptor, Mogera, and
     Scaptochirus; but these are retained here as full
     genera, see Abe et al. (1991) and Gureev
     (1979:256-285). For phylogenetic considerations
     based on morphology, see Stein (1960) and Grulich
     (1971); based on allozyme variation, see
