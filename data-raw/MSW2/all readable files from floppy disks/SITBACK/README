-----------------------------------------------------------------

     1. Considerations on using SitBack with a Novell Network


     When using SitBack in a Novell network environment, you must
     take into account the following items:

     1.   Prior to loading the network shell and other associated
          network programs on a workstation, the program SBOS.EXE
          must be run.  SBOS.EXE enables SitBack to operate in
          Novell network environments.  SBOS.EXE can be placed in
          the AUTOEXEC.BAT file of the workstation boot disk. 
          REMEMBER, this must be loaded prior to any other
          network software on the workstation.

     2.   The SitBack program, SB.EXE must be loaded only AFTER a
          user logs onto the network.
 
     3.   If a Novell server is specified in the "What" and
          "Where" fields of a backup configuration, the user must 
          have appropriate access rights to the specified path. 
 
                    a.   The "What" field will require read access.


                    b.   The "Where" field will require create and
                         write access. 

     4.   In order for SitBack to create the backup directories and
          files, the "Where" field must specify a drive and
          directory where the user has these access rights.  

                    Example: 
 
               Where: I:\USER1\BACKUP 
 
               Since user's do not normally have create access at 
               the root level, only specifying a Novell server's
               drive will usually cause a failure of SitBack's
               attempt to create the backup directory.

     2.   Clearing the backup status of a backup configuration.

     Pressing the tilde (~) key when in the "What and Where to Back
     Up" screen will clear the backup status of the files in the
     configuration at the cursor.  This is the opposite of pressing
     the "T" key for the Total-backup function.  Briefly, the "T"
     key sets the DOS archive bits and the "~" key clears the DOS
     archive bits.

     3.   Getting a listing of your SitBack configuration file.

     A utility program, SBLIST, has been included on the
     distribution disk.  It allows you to get a listing of the
     configuration file used by SitBack.

     To view the listing on the screen, enter:

          SBLIST |more

            |more tells DOS to stop the display at the end of each
            page.

     To print the listing on your printer, enter:

          SBLIST >lpt1

            >lpt1 tells DOS to direct the listing to your printer.

     4.   Using SitBack on IBM and compatible networks.

     SitBack supports the use of the "Uniform Naming Convention"
     for local area networks.  You can use the extended network
     pathname format \\COMPUTERNAME\NETNAME in any place that would
     normally use a DOS drive designation (C:, D:, etc.).

     SitBack will perform implicit Net Use operations whenever it
     requires access to the server path specified in a UNC network
     pathname.  The server session will be disconnected when
     SitBack is completed with the session.

     The "What" and "Where" fields accept either a DOS drive
     designation or a UNC network pathname.  Anytime you modify
     these fields and a UNC network pathname is used, you will be
     prompted for a password.  If the network path requires a
     password, enter it.  If a password is not required, enter a
     carriage return.

     You must insure that your DOS is configured for enough drives.
     The LASTDRIVE parameter in your CONFIG.SYS file should specify
     at least two more drives than you normally use.  For example,
     if you normally have a D and E drive connected to the network
     and you have defined a SitBack configuration that backs up
     from one server to another, SitBack will temporarily require
     the use of two additional drives.  You will need to set the
     LASTDRIVE to G or higher in the CONFIG.SYS file.

     5.   Using SitBack with Microsoft Windows/286 v2.1 and 3.0.

     LOAD SitBack BEFORE you load the windows operating     
     environment. (i.e. issue the SB command before you issue the
     WIN command).

     Create PIF files from within windows using the PIFEDIT.EXE
     program supplied with the windows program.  To create  a PIF
     file for SitBack the following parameters are needed:

          Program Name:       SB.EXE
          Program Title:      SitBack
          Program Parameters: SB
          Initial Directory:  X:\dirname
          Memory Requirements:KB Required 60
                              KB Desired  60
          Directly Modifies:  Memory Keyboard

     Providing the above parameters are used during the creation
     of the PIF file in windows, you should be able to double click
     on the SB.PIF file to invoke SitBack from within the windows
     environment.

     A separate PIF file must be created for each SitBack command.

(SITBACK.EXE, SBLIST.EXE, SB GO, SB PAUSE, ERROR ACKNOWLEDGE, etc.)

     Also, hot-key  combinations such as CTRL-ALT-G, CTRL-ALT-E,
     etc. will not be functional under the windows environment. 
     As stated above a PIF file must be created to execute the
     commands which are equivalent to the SitBack hot-keys.
